# **Project-Title**

### **Landing Page**

# Brief-Description

In this project I used Knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaSript** to build and design a responsive, dynamically-created, Landing page.

The Project simply circles around having a dynamiclly-built navigation menu that scrolls directly to the clicked section of the page.

I've done most of the work using The Udactiy content explained in the videos along with MDN Documentations and some other external resources.
